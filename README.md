# Country Populations Database Project Description

This repository features a collection of C++ files that collectively form a project for analyzing population growth data:

- input.dat: A data file with population statistics, including figures for Australia over several decades. It contains population counts and growth rates, sourced from the World Bank.

- library.cpp: A C++ source file that includes important libraries and functions necessary for data processing. This file is key to the project, providing the functionality for collecting and manipulating the population data.

- library.h: The header file corresponding to library.cpp, which defines the structure for storing country data. This includes elements such as population counts and growth rates, structuring how data is organized and processed.

- main.cpp: The main C++ file of the project, serving as the primary interface for the project's execution. It integrates various components of the project, orchestrating data processing and analysis.

This repository is a practical resource for implementing data analysis using C++. It showcases the use of data structures, file handling, and data processing techniques in a real-world context, making it a valuable tool for developers and data analysts.
